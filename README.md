# Bayesian Linear Regression
Repository containing the work of Kaspara Skovli Gåsvær on Bayesian linear regression. Much of the work found in this repository is based on the books *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* ([Bishop, 2006](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)) and *Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial* ([Sivia, 2006](http://aprsa.villanova.edu/files/sivia.pdf)).

### Articles
This repository contains two papers written on the subject. *An Introduction to Bayesian Linear Regression* ([Gåsvær, 2021](https://github.com/KasparaGaasvaer/BayesianLinearRegression/blob/main/Articles/An_Introduction_to_Bayesian_Linear_Regression.pdf)) covers theoretical background and serves as an easy introduction to the subject intended for those with background mainly from other natural sciences than statistics. *Practical Implementation of Bayesian Inference on Linear Regression Problems* ([Gåsvær, 2021](https://github.com/KasparaGaasvaer/BayesianLinearRegression/blob/main/Articles/Practical_Implementation_of_Bayesian_Inference_on_Linear_Regression_Problems.pdf)) makes use of the theory presented in the former paper for practical implementation purposes. It looks at the implications of model selection and parameter estimation as well as how to interpret the resulting parameters in terms of priors and posteriors.
